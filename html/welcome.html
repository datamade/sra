  <h3>Security Risk Assessments</h3>
  <p>
     The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities to conduct a risk assessment to identify risks and 

vulnerabilities to electronic protected health information (e-PHI). Risk assessment is the first step in an 

organization’s Security Rule compliance efforts. Following HIPAA risk assessment guidelines will help 

you establish the safeguards you need to implement based on the unique circumstances of your health 

care practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Risk assessment is an ongoing process that should provide your medical practice with a detailed 

understanding of the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of e-PHI. HIPAA requires 

that covered entities “implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security 

violations” by conducting “an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities 

to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of e-PHI held by the [organization].” Performing a 

security risk assessment and mitigating the findings is also a requirement for providers attesting to 

“Meaningful Use” under the CMS EHR Incentive Program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providers should develop a risk assessment that addresses these criteria by evaluating the impact and 

likelihood of potential breaches, implementing security features, cataloguing security features, and 

maintaining security protections.
