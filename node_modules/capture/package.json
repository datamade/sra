The format of the screenshot can be anything supported by Phantom, such as PNG, GIF, JPG, or PDF.\n\nCapture is a Node.js based library that can be used as a module within another application, or as a stand alone tool via it's command line interface (CLI).\n\n## Install\n\nTo install capture you must first have Node.js, NPM and PhantomJS installed, all of which is outside the scope of these instructions. Please see the [Node.js Website](http://nodejs.org) for details on how to install Node and NPM. Personaly I am found of Tim Caswell's excelent [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) tool for insalling and managing Node. [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) is also an excelent tool for installing PhantomJS, Node or NPM on a Mac.\n\nOnce NPM is installed, simply install Capture by executing the following from the command line:\n\n\tnpm install capture -g\n\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can explore what capture can do by simply typing `capture` into the command line. You will get the built in help that looks something like this:\n\n\tCapture screenshots of URLs.\n\tUsage: node ./index.js [url1 url2 ...]\n\t\n\tOptions:\n\t  --verbose, -v              Verbose logging                                     [boolean]\n\t  --out, -o                  Output directory for captured screenshots           [string]\n\t  --format, -f               Output image format (png, jpg, gif, pdf)            [string]  [default: \"png\"]\n\t  --phantomjs, -P            Path to phantomjs bin                               [string]\n\t  --username, -u             HTTP Basic Auth Username                            [string]\n\t  --password, -p             HTTP Basic Auth Password                            [string]\n\t  --viewport-width, --vw     Minimum viewport width                              [string]  [default: 1024]\n\t  --viewport-height, --vh    Minimum viewport height                             [string]  [default: 768]\n\t  --paper-format, --pf       Size of the individual PDF pages (A4, letter)       [string]  [default: \"A4\"]\n\t  --paper-orientation, --po  Orientation of the PDF pages (portrait, landscape)  [string]  [default: \"portrait\"]\n\t  --paper-margin, --pm       Margin of the PDF pages (2cm, 5mm, etc.)            [string]  [default: \"2.5mm\"]\n\t  --help, -h                 Show this help message and exit                     [boolean]\n\nExecuting `capture http://your-domain.com/ http://your-domain.com/about/` will create a directory in the current working directory with the following structure:\n\n\tyour-domain-com/\n\t\tindex.png\n\t\tabout/\n\t\t\tindex.png\n\n### Reading JSON from *stdin*\n\nCapture also supports reading in JSON from *stdin*. It will do it's best to find URL's within the data structure. For example, all of the following data structures are valid input:\n\n**Array of strings:**\n\n\tcapture << EOF\n\t[ \"http://your-domain.com\" ]\n\tEOF\n\n**Array of Objects with property of *url*:**\n\n\tcapture << EOF\n\t[ { \"url\": \"http://your-domain.com\" } ]\n\tEOF\n\n**Object with property of *url*:**\n\n\tcapture << EOF\n\t{ \"url\": \"http://your-domain.com\" }\n\tEOF\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\nCapture was written to aid in regression testing of websites where large cross-cutting changes to things such as CSS were made and we wished to understand the visual differences that might exist between an existing version of a site and the newly modified version. To accomplish this, Capture, coupled with [Crawl](http://github.com/mmoulton/crawl) allows us to take screenshots of both the old and new versions of the site, then perform image differencing on the results. One handy tool for performing the image differencing is a Mac app called [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com).\n\n\n## The MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Mike Moulton\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
